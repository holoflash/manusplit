### Don't Shut Me Down
A while ago, I heard the sound of children's laughter 
Now it's quiet, so I guess they left the park
This wooden bench is getting harder by the hour
The sun is going down, it's getting dark
I realize I'm cold, the rain begins to pour
As I watch the windows on the second floor
The lights are on, it's time to go (ooh)
It's time at last, to let him know
I believe it would be fair to say, "You look bewildered"
And you wonder why I'm here today
And so you should, I would
When I left, I felt I've had enough
But in the shape and form, I appear now
I have learned to cope, and love and hope is why I am here now

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah I'm fired up, don't shut me down
I'm like a dream within a dream that's been decoded I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down
I'm not the one you knew, I'm now, and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind (and I won't be the same)
I'm not the same this time around (ooh) I'm fired up, don't shut me down
Will you leave me standing in the hall or let me enter? The apartment hasn't changed at all
I've got to say, "I'm glad"
Once these rooms were witness to our love 
My tantrums and increasing frustration
But I go from mad, to not so bad
In my transformation

And now you see another me, I've been reloaded, yeah I'm fired up, don't shut me down (don't shut me down)
I'm like a dream, within a dream, that's been decoded I'm fired up, I'm hot, don't shut me down
I am not the one you knew (I'm not the one you knew)
I'm now, and then combined
And I'm asking you to have an open mind (now, I'll not be the same)
I'm not the same this time around (ooh)
I'm fired up, don't shut me down
You ask me not to leave
Well, here I am again
And I love you still and so I won't pretend
I have learnt to cope, and love and hope is why I am here now
